## Massmine-For-The-Masses

### Massmine-For-The-Masses is an open-source, proof of concept tool. It extends the functionality of Massmine, a command-line interface which is a data gathering tool. This Massmine-For-The-Masses has a graphical user interface which allows users to see the data being collected from different platforms like Twitter, Tumblr. The collected data will also be presented in a simple user interface to allow for basic analysis. This project is an improvement of the existing project(https://github.com/AnushaVanama/Massmine-for-the-Masses) where all web pages are redisigned  and rearranged to enhance the user experience and offer smooth navigation throughout its design.
