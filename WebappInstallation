#How to install Massmine-for-the-Masses

GET YOURSELF A VM
	1. Install an Ubuntu VM - 18.04 tested. 

BASIC TOOLS TO INSTALL THE REST OF IT
	2. Install git: sudo apt-get install -y git
	3. Install pip: sudo apt install -y python3-pip
	
REPOSITORY CODE INSTALLATION
	4. Get back out and clone the repository: cd && git clone https://github.com/gowthamichinta/Massmine_new.git
	5. Get into cloned directory: cd Massmine-for-the-Masses
	6. (Developers only) Checkout the right branch (for example, I do: git checkout patanzer)
	7. (Developers only) Get back out to your home directory: cd  
	8. Copy webappproject folder into your virtual environment:
	You want to get the 'webapp' folder from Massmine-for-the-Masses/src and put it into the django directory you just created. 
	You can use a file manager, or else do the following command: cp -a Massmine-for-the-Masses/src/. django/

INSTALING MASSMINE
	For your convenience, Massmine 1.1.0 is included in the webapp folder so you don't have to go download it. The website for it is here: https://www.massmine.org/
	9. Unzip the Massmine zip file: unzip django/webapp/massmine-1.1.0-linux-x86_64.zip -d django/
	10. Make massmine executable (may ask for your password): cd django/massmine && sudo ln -s `pwd`/massmine /usr/local/bin

  11.pip install django-encrypted-model-fields
 12.pip install django-tables2
 13.pip install django-import-export
 14.pip install django-utils-six
 15.pip install python-dateutil

MAKING YOUR ENCRYPTION KEYFIXING TIMEZONE ERROR AND OTHER ENVIRONMENT ISSUES
	27. (Ignore for development) Generate a new key:  MYVAR=$( python django/webapp/manage.py generate_encryption_key)
	28. (Ignore for development)Update settings.py to use the new key: sed -i '/FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY/d' django/webapp/webappproject/settings.py && echo "FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY = '$MYVAR'"  >> django/webapp/webappproject/settings.py


CREATING DATABASE
	29. python django/webapp/manage.py makemigrations
	30. python django/webapp/manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
	31. To create your first admin, do: python django/webapp/manage.py createsuperuser and walk through the options to create one

STARTING THE SERVER
	32. Run your server!: python django/webapp/manage.py runserver

You're done! If you close this environment, you can get back into it by cd'ing into the django folder and running: pipenv shell

If you want to have forgot password send to actual emails, you will need to either set up a smtp server or use a third party service and change details in the webapp/webappprojct/settings.py file. Currently, emails are 'sent' to a folder within the project.


Troubleshooting migrations:

	If you are getting the error 'no module named X' when attempting to migrate or run the project, try installing the module listed. Keep in mind that names may not be exact - for example, if you have installed 'enchant' but not 'pyenchant', you will get the error 'no module named enchant'. Refer to the instructions above for instructions on installing modules that may have been missed.

	If you are still having errrs when migrating or running your server, try deleting the contents of all migrations and __pycache__ folders, then start from the step to makemigrations again. Don't forget to do 'migrate --run-syncdb'!

	If there are still issues migrating, you can try deleting the migrations and pycache folders, and also delete the database. THIS WILL DELETE ANY DATA YOU HAVE STORED BEYOND THE ABILITY TO RECOVER, SO BE WARNED!


Troubleshooting running your server:
	
	If you can't see the webpage: This project runs by default at 127.0.01:8000. Check your firewall and make sure that port 8000 and the loopback address are not blocked.

	If you still can't see the webpage: Did you do the 'runserver' command? 
	
	If RabbitMQ isn't working: Do you have port 5672 open? It is the main port for the RabbitMQ server.
